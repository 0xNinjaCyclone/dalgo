# About
dalgo is a simple project that contains an advanced implementation of the most common data structures and algorithms, implemented in C programming language.

# Map
- Algo      : this folder contains the implementation of common algorithms.
- DS        : this folder contains the implementation of common data structures.
- samples   : this folder contains samples of using those algorithms and DS.

## How can i compile samples !?
Each sample has a compilation command (GCC) in a comment in the header of each sample\
You must change the directory to the samples folder before compilation.
